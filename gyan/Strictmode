Strict mode

- places javascript in a strict operating context
- prevents some common errors that end up in buggy code
- throws exceptions on unsafe code
    * foo = 'bar'; <= if foo isn't defined, exception
    * { foo: 'bar', foo: 'baz'} <= exception, cannot create duplicates
    * delete foo <= fails
    * name 'eval' throws an exception
    * cannot create new variables using eval
    * Cannot overwrite arguments to a function
    * (function(){ ... }).call( null ); <= exception, null cannot be forced to be global object
